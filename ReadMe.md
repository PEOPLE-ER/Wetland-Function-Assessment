# Scope of Notebooks:

- Conduct landscape segmentation based on Sentinel-2 images
- Plot time series maps of Sentinel-1 images with False colour
- Aggregate time series of S1 backscatter by landscape units (from landscape segmentation)
- Project S1 time series of landscape units into 2D space using t-SNE algorithm for visualization purpose
- Perform cluster analysis using HDBSCAN algorithm to identify major temporal patterns from samples and generate reference time series for various wetland function types.
- Measure similarity of time series using Dynamic Time Warping (DWT).
